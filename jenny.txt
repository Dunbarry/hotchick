Chapter 1

Jenny. I love you Jenny.

Chapter 2

When we met, it was raining and my hands were shaking. I said to myself that I
had to approach you or I would never forgive myself.

Chapter 3

He looked Jenny in the eyes and said to her “erm.. when I said I love you
I meant the universal you… not just you, exclusively, Jenny. I’m sure you’re
quite lovable but I’ve been getting really into yoga lately, by the way, and
its really helped me express my love for humanity as a whole and manifesting
that through expressing that on an individual basis.” After he spoke these
words he and Jenny both sighed in relief and began to talk about their jobs
as coders.

Chapter 4

As they conversed about the awesomeness of coding, he realized that she was a
jugglo (that's like a nasty person who listens to insane clown possie). And he knew
one song by ICP called Miracles and said "I love that song called Miracles."

"ICP is coming to town and I'm going with some friends. You might be able
to get a ticket if you go talk to my friend Horatio."

Chapter 5
He remembered: Jenny is hot. He loves Jenny. He could overlook a simple things like a love for the ICP.
Why not? It's just one flaw. Everyone have flaws.
He talked to Jenny's friend, Horatio, got the tickets.
The night of the concert, he took some mushrooms and picked up Jenny on his scooter.
The mushrooms kicked in and it expanded his mind while en route to the concert.
As he got comfortable with the idea of an ICP concert and considering the benefits
of getting into new music... he and jenny were pulling into the concert venue's parking lot.
Then... BAAAAAM!!! His journey ended as a Hummer full of ICP fans ran over his scooter, his fragile body,
and jenny's beautiful face. Well, at least he died with Jenny's arms around his body ... and trying
something new!!! :D
